Here at SPRING FINANCE, we are a team of few blockchain enthusiasts who have been devoted to the blockchain industry since 2017. When we first started working together as a team, there were nearly no real use cases applying blockchain technology with a meaningful ways. However, **we knew that in near future the decentralized services will penetrate into the real world.**

Now new incomers such as financial institutions, governments, big-techs, manufacturers, SMEs, and individual investors are showing interest to the blockchain industry. They look into NFTs to use in metaverse. They try to record data on blockchain. They invest in Bitcoin. They study cryptocurrencies to create Central Bank Digital Currency. We realized that **now is the time to think about what it would user want when blockchain-based services became popular and common.**

With user-oriented perspective, our team decided to start **SPRING FINANCE to optimize DeFi experiences through 1\) Yield optimizer 2\) NFT gamification 3\) DeFi search engine.** Please look into our core products \(Spring & Garden\) which will bring truly entertaining financial experience to our fans and community.

**sVaults** is a yield optimization service with safe but brilliant strategies to offer optimized yield to the users. The users will be benefited from additional reward of SPRING tokens.  
**sFarms** is a yield farm service where the users will earn SPRING tokens by farming LPs and SPRING tokens. The users will be benefited from both SPRING token earnings and entrance to the Garden.

With a certain condition met on sFarms by staking a reasonable amount of SPRING LPs, the users will be allowed to enter our unique garden. The Garden is the most unique service that makes us the next generation project among any other players in DeFi Landscape.

DYOR is always the number one principle for DeFi users. However, as more and more DeFi projects through various chains \(Binance chain, Etherium, Solana, Polygon, Terra, etc.\) launches, it is extremely hard for users to find the best service that fit on them. At Library users can search any pair \(LPs\) or crypto they own. Then they can 1\) find out services with the best yield 2\) see the estimated transaction cost and 3\) directly invest through SPRING FINANCE.
