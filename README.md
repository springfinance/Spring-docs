_The spring flows into the river. And the river flows into the sea..._  
  
Here at SPRING FINANCE, we are a team of few blockchain enthusiasts who have been devoted to the blockchain industry since 2017. When we first started working together as a team, it was the time back at the bear market in crypto world with no real use cases applying blockchain technology with a meaningful ways. However, **we knew that in near future the decentralized services will get popular.**   
  
Now new incomers such as financial institutions, governments, big-techs, manufacturers, SMEs, and individual investors are showing interest to the blockchain industry. They look into NFTs to use in metaverse. They try to record data on blockchain. They invest in Bitcoin. They study cryptocurrencies to create Central Bank Digital Currency. **All these trials and implementations from diverse fields and industries finally got us that the perception is changing.**   
  
From many experiences on with financial institutions \(including central banks\), **we decided to start a DeFi project which is 1\) easy-to-use, 2\) community-driven, and 3\) sustainable as a business itself.** Please look into our core products \(Spring & Garden\) which will bring truly entertaining financial experience to our fans and community.

**sVaults** is a yield optimization service with safe but brilliant strategies to offer optimized yield to the users. The users will be benefited from additional reward of SPRING tokens.  
**sFarms** is a yield farm service where the users will earn SPRING tokens by farming LPs and SPRING tokens. The users will be benefited from both SPRING token earnings and entrance to the Garden.

With a certain condition met on sFarms by staking a reasonable amount of SPRING LPs, the users will be allowed to enter our unique garden. The Garden is the most unique service that makes us the next generation project among any other players in DeFi Landscape. See below for more understanding of service concepts.
